 For training, the training pictures must be in keras-frcnn/keras_frcnn/train_images. All the images must be named 
 "1.jpg","2.jpg", etc.
 The labels must be in a .txt file containing the label information as follows:
 
 Image_path/filename.jpg,xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,label
 Image_path/filename2.jpg,xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,label

and so.

Then, in a terminal window go to keras-frcnn and write:
"python3 train_frcnn.py -o simple -p keras_frcnn/annotate.txt" without the quotes, being annotate.txt the file
in which the labels are contained.
To adjust the epoch size and the number of epochs go to train_frcnn.py.

After training, test the RCNN. The test images must be in keras-frcnn/test_images
Then, in a terminal window write:
"python3 test_frcnn.py -p test_images" without quotes.
